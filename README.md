My first attempt at a project all on my own. 

//First Thoughts//
Well I am back. I have been adjusting to university so far. It's been ok but it does sadden me a bit that I have had no time to be coding. I want to continue the journey but so far I am limited to GE classes. 

Eventually I will be able to make it to the coding classes, I heard you teach yourself a lot so we will see how that goes. 

Anyways, I don't even know if I am going to be able to finish this project but I just wanted to put it here just in case I have free time. After all, I do not want to lose everything that I learned over the summer. I need to continue to learn!
